This was a one week VR prototype challenge using the meta presence platform. Goals were to find a way to use hand tracking to interact with objects in an intuative manor. 3 levels of difficulty were created using a timer with decreasing amounts of time the player has to diffuse the bomb. 

All assets were created in blender specifically for this project within the week timelimit.
